should catch.

## Problems in This Text

This is very very important. The writing here is really really bad because 
it uses too many adverbs and weasel words.

Maybe this could be improved by avoiding words like "very", "really", and 
phrases that are kind of unclear.

Obviously, this text clearly demonstrates the kind of issues that should 
definitely be caught by the linting tool.

There are also passive voice constructions that should be identified by 
the tool as potential improvements.
